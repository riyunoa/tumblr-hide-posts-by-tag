tumblr-hide-posts-by-tag
========================

This greasemonkey user script hides tumblr posts on your dashboard by tag.

Instructions
------------
* Install the Greasemonkey Firefox addon
* Edit line 8 of tumblr-post-hider.user.js so that it contains a list of the tags you want to hide.
* Make sure that the tag is surrounded by quotes (i.e. ")
* The code automatically prepends a # for each tag so please leave out the "#" symbol.
* Example: var taglist = ["justin-bieber", "spoilers"]; will hide #justin-bieber and #spoilers.
* Drag the tumblr-post-hider.user.js into the browser window. Greasemonkey will ask for the script to be installed. Click "Install".
